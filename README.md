Created with CodeSandbox - test it [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/gselzer/cs839-hack5)

This project demonstrates a simple multi-marker application for indoor navigation using AR, run within the browser.

Code inspiration and marker patterns drawn from https://github.com/ucl-casa-ce/AFrame_AR_Multimarkers

## Setting the system up for yourself!

The system is currently configured to display directions to get between three locations on floor 3 of the [Computer Sciences Building](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, using 6 AR markers.

To configure this system for your own use, you must currently edit the metadata within `index.html`. 

In a larger project, we'd like to provide pathing algorithms to generate a path network from a floorplan, however this goes a bit beyond the scope of the project.
